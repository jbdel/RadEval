Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. However, if there is concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CTA is more sensitive and should be considered. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 11:30 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery of these findings.
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process. 2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown etiology. 3. No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms. 4. No displaced rib fracture identified. If clinical concern persists, dedicated rib series or chest CT is more sensitive.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour is again seen.
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour is again seen.
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position. 2. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. 3. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 4. Age-indeterminate compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body. Correlate with focal tenderness.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of the descending aorta. No evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Extensive degenerative changes are again seen in the shoulder joints bilaterally.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the postoperative appearance of the right hemithorax. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The left lung remains essentially clear.
As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The right chest tube is in unchanged position. The air collection in the right lateral soft tissues is constant. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the postoperative appearance of the right hemithorax. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The left lung remains essentially clear.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube is in unchanged position. The extent of the known right pneumothorax has not substantially changed. No evidence of tension. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Right subclavian catheter again extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Port-A-Cath extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
1. Interval decrease in size of right pneumothorax. 2. Persistent right upper lobe consolidation. 3. Small right pleural effusion. "Physician to Physician Radiology Consult Line: (863) 134-6103"
As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.
