1. moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. 2. mild pulmonary edema.
1. mild pulmonary edema. 2. small bilateral pleural effusions. i have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreed with the report transcribed above.
1. moderate right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. 2. mild pulmonary edema.
mild pulmonary edema.
low lung volumes with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
ap chest compared to ___ : moderate right pleural effusion has increased, and there is more consolidation at the base of the right lung, which could be atelectasis or pneumonia. moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are unchanged. no pneumothorax.
ap chest compared to ___ : moderate - to - large right pleural effusion has increased, and there is more consolidation at the base of the right lung, which could be either atelectasis or pneumonia. moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are stable. no pneumothorax.
1. moderate right pleural effusion with underlying consolidation, likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia. 2. diffuse interstitial opacities consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
1. new bibasilar opacities, concerning for pneumonia. 2. mild pulmonary edema.

1. endotracheal tube in standard position. 2. enteric tube tip within the stomach but side port is at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by approximately 10 cm for optimal positioning. 3. widening of the superior mediastinum, likely due to an underlying acute aortic injury.
no acute cardiopulmonary process.
low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
1. no evidence of pneumonia. 2. stable post - radiation changes in the right lung.
ap chest compared to ___ : small right apical pneumothorax has decreased since ___, basal pleural tube still in place. subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall has increased. right upper lobe is still collapsed. left lung is clear. heart size is normal.
