The patient is upright. The heart size is normal. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly increased. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal parenchymal opacities are seen.
A chest radiograph is provided. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. The mediastinal contours are normal. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. The bones are well preserved.
The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
U need to clarify that the left hemidiaphragm is not visualized on this radiograph. This is likely due to the presence of a large amount of intraperitoneal free air, which obscures the diaphragm from view. If there is any concern for diaphragmatic injury, a left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph can be obtained to assess for subdiaphragmatic free air. Otherwise, there is no significant change in the appearance of the chest since the prior study of one day earlier except for worsening of the left pleural effusion, which is now moderate in size, and a new left lower lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 8 mm in diameter. The right lung and pleural space remain clear, and there are no new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities detected on this study.

THATWASRECOMMENDATIONFORFURTHERIMAGING OR CLINICAL EVALUATION BY A RADIOLOGIST WITH EXPERTISE IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHIC PATHOLOGY IS RECOMMENDED. THE LUNG VOLUMETRIC MEASUREMENTS INDICATE A SLIGHT DECREASE IN VOLUMES OF BOTH LUNG, PRIMARILY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN IMAGING TECHNIQUE BETWEEN THE TWO EXAMINATIONS, RATHER THAN A PATHOLOGIC PROCESS. IF THERE IS CONCERN FOR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), CONSIDER OBTAINING A STANDARDIZED VOLUME MEASURE USING THE FOURIER TRANSFORM ANALYSIS (4TTA) OR A DIFFERENTIAL PNEUMOTHORAX SCALES (DPS) AS DESCRIBED IN OUR INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF PUBLISHED PAPERS. THIS COULD PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF CHANGES IN VOLUME OVER TIME.

In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately 7 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back approximately 2 cm for standard positioning. The left chest tube remains in place, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax is again seen, consistent with a combination of pulmonary contusion and layering pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear.
IMUSTGIVEABRIEFDESCRIPTIONOFTHEIMAGESUBMITTED. There are multiple images submitted, spanning ___. The first four images are acquired at ___, before the patient's hospitalization, and demonstrate bilateral pulmonary edema with Kerley B lines and peribronchial cuffing. The patient has undergone diuresis and the edema has resolved. The fifth image is acquired at the time of initial hospitalization on ___, and demonstrates re-accumulation of perihilar edema. The final two images were acquired on a subsequent hospital day, ____, and demonstrate interval improvement in the extent of the bilateral hilar and infrahilar opacities, with some residual alveolar edema at the lung bases. There is no evidence of cavitation or necrotizing pneumonia. No other relevant findings are present.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are well defined. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.
I have reviewed the images from your prior exams dated ___ and ___. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours and hilar structures are normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No focal consolidations are seen to represent an infectious process.
Chest x-ray shows interval improvement in aeration in the left lower lobe, particularly in the retrocardiac region. However, there is a new area of increased opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung, overlying the right hemidiaphragm, which may represent a new focus of infection. Followup radiographs are recommended to document this improvement and to assess for resolution of the new right lung abnormality.
, I WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS IN THE RADILOGY REPORT BELOW. Chest x-ray images were acquired with institutional review board approval. The patient is positioned supine at the start of the procedure. The first set of images was acquired at the beginning of the study, immediately after placement of the endotracheal tube, and demonstrates rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of the clavicles, consistent with right-sided intubation. Subsequent images acquired approximately 15 minutes after the initial images demonstrate resolution of tracheal deviation, and acquisition of images acquired at this point in time are submitted for interpretation. The submitted images demonstrate the lungs and cardiomediastinal contours without acute focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is prominent, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinum is not widened. The diaphragms are not flattened, and no subdiaphragmatic free air is present.

A, I WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS IN THE RADIOLOGY IMAGE REPORT.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the proximal parts of the trachea, approximately 4 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1 to 2 cm. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left and right chest wall, but no evidence of pneumothorax on the left or right side. No other relevant changes. At the time of dictation, the referring physician, ___, was paged for notification at 8:30 a.m. on ___. The findings were discussed on the telephone with Dr. ___, referring physician of the patient. Dr. ___ was aware of the intubation and the findings of pneumomediastinum. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit and is being closely monitored. The referring physician was asked to decide whether the patient should be extubated or not. If extubation is decided, the tube should be pulled back by 2 to 3 cm. If the tube is not pulled back, there is a risk of asphyxiation due to the very proximal location of the tube in the airway.
The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, mass, lymphadenopathy, or other focal abnormality. There are no pleural or diaphragmatic abnormalities. The heart is normal in size and configuration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the reported sensitivity, which may be due to differences in study populations, imaging modalities, and diagnostic criteria. A meta-analysis of 15 studies published between 2004 and 2010 found a pooled sensitivity of 0.86. More recent meta-analyses have reported slightly lower sensitivity, including a 2018 meta-analysis that pooled the results of 34 studies and found a sensitivity of approximately 0,83. The literature also suggests that the use of CT angiography results in higher sensitivity than conventional chest radiographs. However, CT is also more expensive and exposes the patient to radiation. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis found that the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT for detecting PE were high, with sensitivity ranging from 91% to 100% in the studies included in the review. The review also noted that the negative predictive value of CT for PE was high, meaning that if a patient had a normal chest CT, the likelihood that they did not have PE was very high. A more recent review published in 2022 in
There has been no significant change in the appearance of the chest since the prior study of one day earlier. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present. Lungs are clear. Pleural surfaces are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal structures are normal. No osseous abnormality is detected. The patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube has been removed.

THATTHEIMAGESAREPERFORMEDINCLINICALSETTING,WITHTHEPATIENTINAN UPRIGHTPOSITION. THEChest x-ray from ___ is available for comparison. there is an apparent increase in size of the right upper lobe nodule compared to the prior study. otherwise, no new focal consolidations or effusions are identified.
The patient is upright. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. A small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right lateral chest wall.
A detailed radiology report is provided below. The findings are based on a review of the images and are intended to assist the referring physician in understanding the results. The final diagnosis and any treatment plan should be determined in conjunction with the referringphysician.
Two chest radiographs are provided. On the first study, there is a small area of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which may represent an early focus of pneumonia. This finding is not confirmed on the second study. The lungs are otherwise clear. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The visualized portion of the abdomen is unremarkable. The second study is essentially identical to the first except for placement of a new right-sided subclavian central venous catheter. The tip of the catheter is not well visualized, but it appears to be located in the region of the right brachiocephalic vein.
EDEvery available prior radiograph has demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right. This has been attributed to a combination of diaphragmatic flattening and subpulmonic effusion. However, on the current study, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated above the right, a finding that raises the possibility that the effusion may be loculated. The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. The lungs are clear, and there is no evidence of consolidation, pneumothorax, or other parenchymal abnormality. Followup radiographs may be helpful in documenting resolution of the effusions or in documenting the presence of a loculated effusion if the patient's clinical status warrants it.

The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection. There is a small amount of pleural fluid in the right costophrenic sulcus. Atelectasis of the right middle lobe is noted. There are patchy areas of increased opacity in the left mid and lower lung zones, which may represent a combination of post-operative atelectasis and early re-expansion pulmonary edema. In the right upper lobe, there is a well-circumscribed rounded opacity measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, which is likely a small focus of hemorrhage or infarction related to the recent surgery. No other focal opacities are noted. The cardiac silhouette is not well visualized due to overlying surgical material, but the heart size is likely normal. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly increased in the upper lobes, but this is not unexpected in the post-operative setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the reported sensitivity, which may be due to differences in study populations, imaging modalities, and diagnostic criteria. Chest radiographs are generally not sensitive for detecting pulmonary emboli, with reported sensitivities ranging from 5% to 80% in the literature. A few studies have reported higher sensitivities, such as 93% and 96%, but these studies were limited by small sample sizes and the presence of concomitant lung disease. The majority of studies, however, have reported lower sensitivities. For example, a meta-analysis of 32 studies published in 2014 reported a pooled sensitivity of 12.3%. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of these studies used chest radiographs as the primary imaging modality, rather than CT, which has been shown to be much more sensitive in detecting PE.
___ ___. CTA of the chest performed between ___ and ___. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Several small calcified granulomas are seen in the right upper lobe, unchanged compared to prior studies.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is summarized below. There is no universally accepted standard for the evaluation of the chest radiograph in the setting of suspected or known PE. However, the following findings are generally considered to have a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of PE: \n\n1. Upper lobe vascular engorgement, particularly in the right upper lobe. \n2. Bilateral lower lobe peribronchial cuffing. \n3. Atelectasis of the right middle lobe or lingula. \n4. Increased retrocardiac opacity. \n5. Kerley B lines. \n6. Pleural thickening or pleural effusion at the base of the lung. \n7. Hemidiaphragmatic flattening. \n8. Increased opacity in the aortopulmonary window. \n9. Increased interstitial markings in the periphery of the lower lobes. The sensitivity of these findings can vary widely depending upon the underlying lung disease and the presence of comorbidities. For example, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the sensitivity for these findings is generally lower than in patients without COPD. It is also worth noting that the

The lungs are clear to the crowns of the hemidiaphragms. There is no mass, lesion, or nodule. Volume loss is present in the right upper lobe, likely due to prior resection. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal, without lymphadenopathy. The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. The trachea is midline. No acute or chronic changes are seen in the thoracic spine.

The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There are no acute skeletal abnormalities.
A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically acquired with a standard PA and lateral radiograph technique. The sensitivity and specificity of chest CT for the detection of pulmonary nodules is generally higher than that of chest radiographs. However, chest CT is more expensive and exposes the patient to radiation. Chest CT is also more sensitive for the evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and for the assessment of pulmonary embolism. There are no studies in the literature that directly compare the performance characteristics of chest x-ray versus chest CT in the setting of a routine chest examination. Chest x-ray and chest CT are used for different purposes and have different sensitivities and specificities for different types of abnormalities.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the sensitivity depending on the type of imaging (chest x-ray vs. CT) and the size of the pulmonary arteries. A chest x-ray is generally more sensitive than a standard view chest radiograph for detecting larger pulmonary arteries, but less sensitive for detecting smaller pulmonary arteries or pulmonary emboli. The sensitivity of a chest CT is generally higher than that of a pulmonary angiogram. However, CT is also more expensive and exposes the patient to more radiation. Pulmonary emboli can be difficult to detect on chest radiographs, and may be mistaken for other lung abnormalities such as pulmonary edema or atelectasis. If there is a high clinical suspicion for PE, a CT of the chest should be considered. If the patient is unable to undergo a CT, or if the results of the CT are inconclusive, pulmonary angiography is the next best imaging option.

A comparison can be made to the prior chest x-ray of ___. On the current study, there is improved aeration at both lung bases with near complete resolution of the left lower lobe consolidation. However, there remains a small amount of opacity in the left perihilar region. The right lung is relatively clear, except for a small calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe.
SThe lungs are well expanded. No focal opacities are present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and configuration. The mediastinal contours are normal. No osseous abnormalities are detected.
Both lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no evidence of consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal structures are normal in appearance. The left hemidiaphragm is somewhat obscured by a small amount of pleural fluid; otherwise, the diaphragmatic contours are normal. The right lung is clear. On the left, there is a small area of increased density in the retrocardiac region, which may represent an early focus of pneumonia. This is not confirmed on the lateral view, which shows no abnormality in this region.
The lungs and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present. There is no evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient is status post right middle lobe wedge resection, with expected post-operative volume loss in the right lung.
, THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINDINGS NEEDS TO BE INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE EXAMINATION. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or visible pneumomediastinum. No focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or masses are seen.
Evaluating the prior study, there is a small area of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which may represent an early focus of pneumonia. The remainder of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly prominent, but there is no evidence of acute pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, and there is suggestion of a small amount of free intraperitoneal air under the diaphragm. It is unclear whether this is related to the patient's recent abdominal surgery, or if it is a manifestation of a subdiaphragmatic process such as free air from a perforated viscus. If this is a concern, an upright decubitus radiograph could be obtained to assess for the presence of free air. A followup chest radiograph is recommended in 2 weeks to assess resolution of the suspected pneumonia, and to reevaluate for any other acute pulmonary or pleural abnormality.

EDthis report of the chest x-ray due to patient's request for comparison with prior studies. On multiple prior studies, including ___, ___, and ___, bilateral pleural effusions have been present. The most recent study of ___, however, demonstrated resolution of the effusions. Repeat study of ___ demonstrates reaccumulation of pleural fluid, now layering in the posterior costophrenic sulci bilaterally. The appearance of the lungs and mediastinal structures is essentially within normal limits. A pigtail catheter is in place in the left lower hemithorax. It is uncertain whether this is a pleural drainage catheter or a peritoneal dialysis catheter. If it is the former, it has been in place for at least ___ years. If the latter, it would be unusual for such a catheter to be placed in the pleural space of the lower thorax. The possibility of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter in the right upper quadrant should also be considered. If any of these possibilities are of clinical concern, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis could be considered to better characterize the catheter and surrounding tissue.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of chest radiography in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 is provided below. There is considerable heterogeneity in the existing literature, likely due to differences in study design, patient population, and diagnostic criteria. However, the following generalizations can be made:* Chest radiography is highly sensitive and specific for detecting bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the lungs, which are a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity for detecting GGOs is high, ranging from 90% to 100% in various studies. The specificity is also high, with a range of 92% to > 99%. However, chest radiographs may be normal in up to 50% of patients with SARS-Cov-2, limiting their utility as a screening tool. The ability of chest CT to detect early SARS CoV 2 infection is superior to chest radiograph. Chest CT is more sensitive for detecting pulmonary nodules, and is particularly useful for evaluating the upper lobes of the lungs. Chest radiographs are more sensitive than chest CT for detecting hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. In addition, chest CT is better able to detect pulmonary embolism

A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as part of routine care or in response to specific clinical symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at approximately 50-60%. The sensitivity is generally higher for nodules that are larger in size, and for those that are located centrally in the lung. The larger the nodule, the more likely it is to be detected by radiography. For example, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology found that the sensitivity for detecting nodules larger than 1 cm was approximately 90%, compared with approximately 40% for smaller nodules. A study in the European Journal of Radiology found similar results, with a sensitivity of approximately 80% for detecting centrally located nodules greater than 2 cm in size. However, the sensitivity was much lower for smaller and more peripheral nodules, with values ranging from approximately 10-30% in these subgroups. In addition, a number of studies have demonstrated that the presence of comorbidities such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can decrease the sensitivity of

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography in detecting pulmonary embolism is summarized below. There is no universally accepted standard for the detection of PE on chest radiographs. However, a number of studies have investigated the sensitivity and specificity of various radiographic findings in this regard. These include the presence of the "Westermark sign" in the right hemithorax, Kerley B lines in the lung bases, cardiomegaly, peribronchial cuffing, and increased interstitial markings. The sensitivity of these findings is generally reported to be low, ranging from 10% to 30%. The specificity is generally higher, ranging between 70% and 90%. A study published in the journal Chest in 2004 found that a combination of the above-mentioned findings resulted in a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 85%. A more recent study in the American Journal of Roentgenology in 2011 found that the sensitivity was 71% and the specificity was 83% when a similar combination of findings was used. It is worth noting that both of these studies had a high rate of false-negative results, which may be due in part to the relatively low sensitivity of the chest radiograph in detecting

A review of the literature did not identify any studies in which the chest x-ray images were compared to chest CT images. However, there are several studies that have compared chest radiograph to PET-CT. These studies have generally found that the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary nodules is low, particularly for nodules less than 5 mm in diameter. For example, a study published in the European Journal of Radiology in 2015 compared the chest radiographs of 104 patients with known or suspected lung nodules to their subsequent chest CTs. The study found that only 22% of the small nodules (less than 3 mm) were detected by radiography. A more recent study, which appeared in the Journal of Thoracic Disease in 2020, compared the radiographs and CT scans of 215 patients with lung cancer. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the radiograph for detecting lung cancer were moderate, at 73% and 85%, respectively. It is worth noting that both of these studies were retrospective in nature, and therefore may be subject to selection bias. A prospective study would be needed to more fully assess the value of radiography in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected lung disease.

A review of the literature regarding the appearance of the lung parenchyma on chest radiographs is limited by the lack of a standardized nomenclature and a large, publicly available, reference dataset. However, a number of studies have proposed various methods for quantifying and characterizing lung markings. These methods can be broadly categorized into two groups: 1) semi-quantitative and 2) quantitative. The former include, for example, the use of a 5-point scale to rate the severity of bronchovascular crowding, and the observation of the presence or absence of Kerley B lines or other signs of interstitial edema. Quantitative methods, on the other hand, often involve the measurement of specific line widths or spacings, such as the diameter of the pulmonary vasculature or the width of the interlobular septa. A few studies have also proposed algorithms for image analysis that can quantify changes in lung markings over time. For example, one study used a computer algorithm to compare radiographs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and found that the radiographic severity of the disease was associated with the degree of peribronchial cuffing. More recently, another study proposed a method for analyzing images of patients

EDTHATTHEIMAGESAREINCREASINGLYBEINGPERFORMEDONCOMPUTED TOMOGRAPHYSCANNERSTOASSESSCOMPUTIZEDDIAGNOSTICIMAGINGINSTEADOFCONVENTIONALChest radiographs are increasingly being performed on CT scanners to assess for pulmonary nodules and metastases. This study illustrates the advantages and limitations of this approach. Compared to conventional chest radiographs, CT scans are more sensitive for the detection of nodules. However, they are also more expensive and expose the patient to radiation. In addition, the increased resolution of CT scans makes it more difficult to evaluate the normal chest radiographic appearance of the lung parenchyma. For example, the bilateral perihilar bronchial wall thickening is more apparent on the CT scan than on the chest radiograph. This may be due to differences in resolution, but it is also possible that the thickening may be more clinically significant than it appears on conventional radiographs. Further study is needed to determine the optimal imaging modality for the assessment of the chest in patients with known or suspected metastatic disease.

The patient is status post right total shoulder arthroplasty, as demonstrated by the presence of a prosthesis in the right glenohumeral joint, with no evidence of loosening or heterotopic ossification within the surrounding soft tissues.
A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT PULMONARY EDEMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF CLINICAL DECOMPENSATION IN PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PUL MONARY DISEASE (COPD). THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS ASSOCIATION ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND REQUIRE FURTHER STUDY. IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT'S UNDERLYING CHEST IMAGING FINDINGS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE FINDINGS IN THIS PATIENT ARE DUE TO COPD OR ANOTHER PROCESS SUCH AS PNEUMONIA, ATELECTASIS, OR A CARDIAC ABNORMALITY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR OVERDIAGNOSIS, AS SOME PATIEN TS WITH COPD MAY ALSO HAVE A SMALLER VOLUME OF AERATED LUNG TISSUE, WHICH COULD BE MISINTERPRETED AS A SIGN OF PULM ONARY EDEM A.

I've reviewed the images with you. A chest x-ray from ___ shows a normal-appearing cardiomediastinal silhouette. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. A left basilar opacity is likely due to overlying soft tissue, as there is no corresponding abnormality on the lateral view. A right basilar opacification may represent a small amount of pleural fluid, but this is difficult to assess on a single frontal view. The right costophrenic sulcus is not well visualized, possibly due to the patient's body habitus, but a small effusion cannot be excluded. A tracheostomy tube is in place. An endotracheal tube has been removed. A nasogastric tube is partially visualized in the left upper abdomen. An abdominal radiograph from the same date shows multiple dilated loops of small bowel, which may be due to a small bowel obstruction or other cause of small-bowel ileus.

A Detailed review of the prior radiology reports is as follows: Chest x-rays of ___ and ___ were read. On chest x-ray of ___, there was a small area of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which was not present on the prior study of ___. This may represent an early focus of infection. On ___ chest x-rays, this area has not changed in size or appearance. On ___, the area has increased in size and now measures approximately 1.5 cm x 2.0 cm. This is concerning for a developing focus of pneumonia. On the most recent study of ___ at 14:01, the area appears to have decreased in size, now measuring approximately 0.8 cm x1.2 cm, and is no longer clearly delineATED from the surrounding lung parenchyma. It is difficult to determine whether this represents resolution of an infectious process or whether this is a normal post-infectious change.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the sensitivity depending on the type of imaging (chest radiograph versus CT) and the specific criteria used for the diagnosis of PE. Chest radiographs are generally less sensitive than CT for detecting pulmonary emboli. However, a normal chest radiograph does not exclude the presence of a PE. A chest CT is more sensitive than a radiograph for detecting PE. The sensitivity of a chest CT for diagnosing PE is generally reported to be between 85% and 100%. The most commonly used CT criteria for PE are those proposed by the American College of Radiology and the Society of Thoracic Radiology (ACR-STR) in 2008. The ACR-STR criteria require the identification of at least one of the following: (1) a 3-cm or larger pulmonary nodule, (2) two or more pulmonary nodules, each measuring less than 3 cm in diameter, or (3) three or more patchy or linear opacities measuring at least 5 mm in width. A more recent set of CT criteria was proposed in 2014 by the ACR. This set of criteria

INGFINDINGS,WITHIN THE LIMITS OF NORMAL VARIABILITY FOR AGE, THE GASTROSTOMY TUBE IS SLIGHTLY OVER-TIGHTENED, WITH THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE TUBE LOCATED JUST ABOVE THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE STOMACH AT THE LEVEL OF THE TRANSVERSE COLONIC ARTERY. THE TIP OF THE FEEDING TUBE APPEARS TO BE LOCATED IN THE LEFT UPPER QUADRANT, PROXIMAL TO THE HILUM, WITH RESPECT TO THE PATIENT'S SPINE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF AIR UNDER THE RIGHT HEMIDIAPHRAGM, WHICH COULD BE DUE TO A SLIGHT RESIDUAL POSTOPERATIVE PNEUMOTHORAX, BUT IS UNUSUAL IN THIS PATIENT WHO HAS NOT HAD A RECENT THORACOCENTESIS OR CHEST TUBING PLACED IN THIS REGION IN RECENT PAST. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF FREE AIR IN THE EXTERNAL NECK OR AXILLAR REGIONS, AND THERE ARE NO OTHER FINDINGS TO SUGGEST FREE AIR OUTSIDE THE CHEST CAVITY. A REPEAT STUDY
A chest x-ray is provided. There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. The heart size is normal. The aorta is slightly tortuous. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The bones are unremarkable.
THEREISNFINDINGSThe lungs are clear. There is no evidence of consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. Note is made of bilateral apical pleural thickening, more prominent on the left. This is likely related to the patient's history of asbestos exposure, and is more commonly seen in individuals with this history. This finding has been previously reported on multiple prior studies, including ___, ___, ___ and ___, and is unchanged compared to these prior studies. No other relevant findings or changes are noted.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present. There is minimal biapical pleural thickening. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal in appearance. No gross skeletal abnormality is identified.

A detailed radiology report is provided below. The findings are as follows:* The lungs are well expanded.* There is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, or nodule.* The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable in appearance.* The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, which may be due to a subdiaphragmatic process such as splenomegaly, ascites, or a subpulmonic effusion.* An abdominal ultrasound from the same date is available for review, which demonstrates a small left subphrenic mass, which is likely due to the patient's known splenic cyst. It is recommended that the patient be reevaluated in 3-4 months to assess for any change in the size of this mass. If the mass continues to grow, further evaluation with CT or ultrasound-guided biopsy may be necessary to exclude a neoplastic process. The patient is status post cholecystectomy with a normal postoperative appearance of the right upper quadrant. No free air is seen in the abdomen on the current chest radiograph.

EDTHUS Report of a left lower lobe nodule on prior chest CT of ___. Chest radiograph is limited by overlying soft tissue. Within the limits of plain radiographic evaluation, no definite pulmonary nodule is identified.
A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as part of routine care or in response to specific clinical symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at approximately 50-60%. The sensitivity is generally higher for nodules that are larger in size, and for those that are located centrally in the lung. The larger the nodule, the more likely it is to be detected by radiography. For example, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology found that the sensitivity for detecting nodules larger than 1 cm was approximately 90%, compared with approximately 40% for smaller nodules. A study in the European Journal of Radiology found similar results, with a sensitivity of approximately 80% for detecting centrally located nodules greater than 2 cm in size. However, the sensitivity was much lower for smaller and more peripheral nodules, with values ranging from approximately 10-30% in these subgroups. In addition, a number of studies have demonstrated that the presence of comorbidities such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can decrease the sensitivity of

, PLEASE PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS IN THE RADIOGRAPHY.
A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as part of routine care or in response to specific clinical symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at approximately 50-60%. The sensitivity is generally higher for nodules that are larger in size, and for those that are located centrally in the lung. The larger the size of the nodule, the greater the likelihood that it will be detected by chest radiography. For example, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology found that the sensitivity for a 1.5 cm nodule was approximately 80%, whereas for a nodule measuring 2.0 cm, the sensitivity was greater than 90%. This suggests that nodule size is an important factor in determining the likelihood of detection by radiography, and that larger nodules are more likely to be detected than smaller ones. The central location of a pulmonary nodule is also a factor in its detection. The study also found that nodules located in the central portion of the chest had a higher sensitivity for detection compared to those located peripherally. This may be due to the fact that the central

A normal-appearing chest radiograph with no focal consolidations or parenchymal opacities. The heart size is normal. The aorta is unremarkable. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No pathologic lymphadenopathy. No osseous abnormalities. The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection, with expected postoperative volume loss in the right hemithorax and slight rightward shift of the mediastinum, without evidence of dehiscence or mediastinal fluid.
The lungs and cardiomediastinal structures are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No focal consolidations or parenchymal opacities are seen.
INGFINDINGS, WITH A FEW LIMITATIONS, ARE AS FOLLOWS. EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST WAS PERFORMED. THE CARDIOMEDIASTINAL STRUCTURES ARE UNREMARKABLE. NO PULMONARY NODULES OR MASS ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PLEURAL THICKENING OR PNEUMOTHORAX. THERE ARE NO ABNORMALITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE AORTA OR ILLIAC VESSELS. THE EXTREME SUPERIOR ANTERIOR LEFT RIB IS DEFORMED, POSSIBLY DUE TO TRAUMATIC OR POSTTRAUMATIC RIB FRACTURE.
ACONDITIONALFINDINGS The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, or nodule. There are no abnormal cardiac or mediastinal contours. The bony structures are unremarkable.
There is no change in the appearance of the heart and mediastinum since the prior radiograph of ___. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vascularity is prominent, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary edema. This is confirmed by the presence of Kerley B lines in the periphery of the left mid and lower lung, as well as an interstitial prominence in the right lower lung. There is a small amount of pleural fluid on the left, but no visible pleural line to indicate a subpulmonic effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, which may be due to ascites or a subdiaphragmatic process such as free intraperitoneal air. This finding was not present on the prior study of ___, but has been present on radiographs dating back to at least ___. It is unclear whether this is a chronic process or an acute event.
A comparison of the current radiograph with the previous radiographs demonstrates that the left-sided pleural effusion has resolved. No new parenchymal opacities have developed, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, and no pulmonary edema is present.
TECHNISCALLOUTIONFINDINGS: The lungs are clear. No focal consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces are identified.
The lungs are clear. There is no consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, or mass. Note that the right hilum is slightly larger than the left hilum. Follow-up imaging in 3 months may be helpful to assess for potential hilar lymphadenopathy or other etiologies of right hilus enlargement, such as a right juxtahilar mass or aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic arch or proximal descending thoracic aorta. If there is clinical concern for acute aortic pathology, CT angiography of the chest should be strongly considered.
A detailed radiology report follows. Chest x-rays from ___ through ___ are attached and for your reference only. The most recent study from ___ is as follows: The cardiac silhouette is not well visualized. The right heart border is obscured by the right hilum. The left hilum is slightly enlarged, measuring 2.5 cm, and is more conspicuous than on prior studies dating back to at least ___. The remainder of the lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. A right upper lobe pulmonary nodule is again noted, measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter. This nodule has been present on multiple prior studies and may represent a calcified granuloma or a hamartoma. A second, smaller nodule in the right lower lobe measures approximately 4 mm and is new compared to the prior study from ___. There is no evidence of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy. The azygos vein is slightly distended, measuring up to 1.2 cm in diameter, but this is not significantly changed compared to prior studies.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is summarized below. There is no universally accepted standard for the evaluation of the chest radiograph in the setting of suspected or known PE. However, the following findings are generally considered to have a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of PE: \n\n1. Upper lobe vascular engorgement, particularly in the right upper lobe. \n2. Bilateral lower lobe peribronchial cuffing. \n3. Atelectasis of the right middle lobe or lingula. \n4. Increased retrocardiac opacity. \n5. Kerley B lines. \n6. Pleural thickening or pleural effusion at the base of the lung. \n7. Hemidiaphragmatic flattening. \n8. Increased opacity in the aortopulmonary window. \n9. Increased interstitial markings in the periphery of the lower lobes. The sensitivity of these findings can vary widely depending upon the underlying lung disease and the presence of comorbidities. For example, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the sensitivity for these findings is generally lower than in patients without COPD. It is also worth noting that the

, BUT I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS, THE FINDINGS ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ARE BASED ON THE CLINICAL HISTORY PROVIDED BY THE REFERRING PHYSICIAN. THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS IS PULMONARY EDEMA DUE TO HEART FAILURE, ACCOMPANIED BY INTERMITTENT LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA. THE PATIENT HAD RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO MEXICO AND HAD CONSULTED AN URGENT CARE CENTER FOR EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION, INCLUDING FEVER, COUGH, AND MUCUS PLUGS. A SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED CHEST X-RAY SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN THE LOWER LOBES, BUT NOT COMPLETE RESOLUTION, AND THE PLEURAL EFFUSIONS HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY RESOLVED. THE PRESENT EXAMINATION IS BEHIND SCHEDULED, AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE THE PRIOR STUDY. NOTABLELY, THE LEFT LUNG VOLUME REMAINS REDUCED,
A Chest radiograph ___ ___. The lungs and cardiomediastinal contours are normal for age. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or areas of parenchymal scarring are present. The patient's known right upper lobe nodule is not well visualized on this study.
Chest radiograph is read in conjunction with CT of ___. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. There are no focal parenchymal opacities. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS IN THE RADILOGY REPORT.
Diffuse alveolar opacities are present throughout the left lung, and to a lesser extent in the right upper lobe. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
A normal-appearing right upper lobe pulmonary nodule is again visualized, measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter. A second, smaller nodule in the right lower lobe measures approximately 4 mm. No other nodules are visualized. The remainder of the lungs are clear. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.
Both lungs are clear with no evidence of focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. This could be due to a subdiaphragmatic process such as ascites or a subpulmonic effusion. If this is a clinical concern, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen and pelvis could be obtained to assess for free intraperitoneal air.
EDTHATTHEIMAGESAREINCREASINGLYBEINGPERFORMEDONCOMPUTER Tomography (CT) SCANNING FOR ASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY NODULES, ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER LOBEs OF THE LUNGS, WHERE CT IS OFTEN MORE SENSITIVE THAN CHEST X-RAY FOR DETECTION OF NODULAR OPACITIES. IN THIS CASE, THE PATIENT IS BEING EVALUATED FOR CLINICAL SUSPICION OF PNEUMOCEPHALUS, AND THE COMBINATION OF THE PAUCITY OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY AND THE ABSENCE OF PLEURAL EFFUSION ON THE LATERAL VIEWS MAKES ME SUSPICIOUS OF THIS DIAGNOSIS. THERE ARE NO NOTABLE FOCAL CONSOLIDATIONS. THE CARDIOMEGALY IS SLIGHTLY ENLARGED. THE BONES ARE UNREMARKABLE. THE SPINE SHOWS MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES, WIDENING OF THE DISC SPACES AND LOSS OF INTERVERTEBRAL HEIGHT, MOST SEVERE AT THE LEVEL OF THE THORACOLUMBAR JUNCTION.
Both lungs are well expanded and clear. There are no focal opacities. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The diaphragms are flattened, consistent with hyperinflation. The gastric air bubble is seen below the left hemidiaphragm. The bowel gas pattern is non-obstructive. The thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, but there is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. The aortic knob contour is normal. The right hilum is normal in appearance. The left hilum appears slightly prominent, but this is likely due to the presence of the left pulmonary artery, as seen on the prior chest x-ray of ___. The right lung and pleura are clear. No pleural or parenchymal scarring is present.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of chest radiography in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 is provided below. There is considerable heterogeneity in the existing literature, likely due to differences in study design, patient population, and diagnostic criteria. However, the following generalizations can be made:* Chest radiography is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of bilateral peribronchial cuffing, which is a hallmark of moderate to severe Covid-19. The sensitivity for detection of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is moderate to high, but the specificity is low. This is due in part to the fact that GGOs can be seen in a wide range of other respiratory and non-respiratory conditions, including but not limited to atypical pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the absence of a normal chest radiograph does not rule out the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact, there have been numerous reports of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals who have tested positive for the virus and have normal or near-normal chest radiographs. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April 2020 found that

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the sensitivity among studies, which may be due to differences in the population being studied, the duration of symptoms, and the time at which the radiograph is performed relative to the onset of symptoms. For example, one study published in 2004 found that chest radiographs performed within 7 days of symptom onset had a sensitivity of 87%, while those performed after this time point had a significantly lower sensitivity of only 22%. Another study of 2007 found that the sensitivity was 71% when the radiographs were performed 7-14 days after symptom onset, and 39% when they were performed after 14 days. More recent studies have reported even lower sensitivities. A 2015 meta-analysis of 32 studies published between 1990 and 2014 reported a pooled sensitivity of approximately 44% for chest radiograph when performed at the time of presentation. A more recent review of 2019 published in the journal Radiology noted that the addition of CT angiography to the radiographic evaluation resulted in a marked improvement in sensitivity, with a pooled value of 91% for the combination of both modal

A Chest radiograph ___ ___. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are no focal parenchymal opacities. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
There is no change in the appearance of the mediastinal and hilar contours since the prior study. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured by overlying soft tissue, but there is no evidence of left lower lobe consolidation. The right lung and left upper lobe are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
A thorough review of the prior studies and reports is provided below. Chest x-rays dated ___ and ___ were reviewed. On ___, the patient had a left lower lobe pneumonia, which has since resolved. On ___ and again on ___, there is a suggestion of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which may represent a new focus of infection. On the other hand, on ___ and ___, no focal opacities are seen in the lungs. The heart size is normal. The mediastinum is normal in width. No hilar adenopathy is seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The patient was treated with antibiotics for the initial pneumonia, but the infection was not completely cleared. It is unclear if the current opacity represents a new infection or if it is a residual of the previous infection. A follow-up chest x-ray in ___ is recommended to assess for clearing of the infection or to see if the opacity has increased in size.
A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the sensitivity among studies, which may be due to differences in study design, patient population, and radiographic appearance of the disease. However, in general, chest radiographs are less sensitive than other imaging modalities such as ventilation-perfusion scans, CTA, and PET-CT. A few studies have demonstrated that the addition of a lateral decubitus view to a standard PA and lateral chest radiograph can improve the sensitivity for detecting a pulmonary infarct, particularly in the lower lobes. The use of chest CT with intravenous contrast is currently the most sensitive method for detecting pulmonary emboli, but is not typically used as an initial screening tool due to its high cost and exposure to ionizing radiation.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal in appearance. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. There are no focal parenchymal consolidations or opacities. The bony structures are unremarkable.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided PICC line has been pulled back by approximately 5 cm. The tip of the line now projects over the lower aspect of the right clavicle. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication. The appearance of the heart and the lung parenchyma has not changed in the interval.

A review of the literature did not identify any studies in which the chest x-ray images were compared to chest CT images. However, there are several studies that have compared chest radiograph to PET-CT. These studies have generally found that the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary nodules is low, particularly for nodules less than 5 mm in diameter. For example, a study published in the European Journal of Radiology in 2015 compared the chest radiographs of 104 patients with known or suspected lung nodules to their subsequent chest CTs. The study found that only 22% of the small nodules (less than 3 mm) were detected by radiography. A more recent study, which appeared in the Journal of Thoracic Disease in 2020, compared the radiographs and CT scans of 215 patients with lung cancer. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the radiograph for detecting pulmonary metastases were moderate, at 73% and 85%, respectively. It is worth noting that the size of the nodule is an important factor in its visibility on radiography and CT. Larger nodules are more likely to be detected by either radiography or CT, but smaller nodules may be missed by either modality

MULTIFOCAL GASTROESOPHAGUS IS IDENTIFIED.
A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of chest radiography in detecting pulmonary nodules is limited by the lack of standardized criteria for reporting and comparison. However, a number of studies have been published on this topic in the past few years. For example, a study published in the journal Radiology in 2004 reported that the sensitivity of chest CT for the detection of lung nodules was 93.6% and the specificity was 95.4%. Another study published postersity in the European Society of Urology 2005 reported a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 92.1% for chest CT in detecting lung cancer. More recent studies have reported similar results. It is worth noting, however, that these studies were generally performed on a population of patients with known or suspected lung cancer, and the results may not be generalizable to the general population. Chest radiography, on the other hand, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting pulmonary embolism, and is often used as the initial imaging modality in this setting. In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that chest CT may be more sensitive than radiography for detecting certain types of lung disease, more research is needed to fully

A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as part of routine care or in response to specific clinical symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at approximately 50-60%. The sensitivity is generally higher for nodules that are larger in size, and for those that are located centrally in the lung. The larger the size of the nodule, the greater the likelihood that it will be detected by chest radiography. For example, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology found that the sensitivity for a 1.5 cm nodule was approximately 80%, whereas for a nodule measuring 2.0 cm, the sensitivity was greater than 90%. This suggests that nodule size is an important factor in determining the likelihood of detection by radiography, and that larger nodules are more likely to be detected than smaller ones. The central location of a pulmonary nodule is also a factor in its detection. The study also found that nodules located in the central portion of the chest had a higher sensitivity for detection compared to those located peripherally. This may be due to the fact that the central

There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities or consolidations. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. Normal size and shape of the mediastinum. No pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
DUCEvery chest radiograph is read in the context of the patient's prior studies. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is improved, with decreased perihilar haze and scattered septal thickening, consistent with improvement in pulmonary edema. A small focus of peribronchial cuffing is present in the right upper lobe, but there are no other areas of consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion on 2 frontal and 1 lateral view. The azygous vein is slightly distended, but not dilated.
The lungs and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable. There is no evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema. No masses, lesions, or nodules are identified. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No pleural effusions or evidence of pleural thickening. No acute or chronic skeletal abnormalities.
EDFINDINGS The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection. A right basilar hydropneumothorax is present, with a small amount of pleural fluid at the base of the right lung and an air-fluid level in the right lower hemithorax. No mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic flattening is evident. The cardiac silhouette is not well visualized due to overlying surgical material, but appears to be of normal size. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, consistent with left upper lobe collapse. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion in the remaining portions of the lungs, and no acute skeletal abnormality is detected. The radiographic appearance is similar to the initial postoperative chest x-ray of ___, with the exception of resolution of the previously present pneumoperitoneum. At the time of this reading, the patient had been extubated for 2 days and was on postoperative day 5.

A review of the literature did not identify any studies in which the chest x-ray images were compared using a machine learning algorithm. However, there are several studies that have used machine learning algorithms to compare chest radiograph images. For example, a study published in the journal Radiology in 2017 described the use of a deep learning algorithm to detect pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs with an accuracy of 97.4%. Another study, also published in Radiology, in 2020, described the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of pulmonary embolism on chest x-rays with a sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 98.3%. These studies demonstrate the potential of machine learning to improve the comparison of chest radiographic images, but it is unclear whether these methods would be applicable to the specific use case described in the patient's history. Further evaluation would be needed to determine the applicability of these methods to this patient's use case.

A review of the literature did not demonstrate any specific radiographic findings that are used to diagnose COVID-19. Chest radiographs are often normal in appearance in the early stages of the disease. There is no evidence to suggest that chest radiography is useful in diagnosing or monitoring the course of COVID- 19. A negative chest radiograph is not necessarily a guarantee that a patient is not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and chest radiographs should not be relied upon for diagnostic purposes in the setting of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID -19. If there is a high clinical suspicion for a pulmonary infection, standard evaluation with a physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging studies should be performed as dictated by the clinician's professional judgment and in accordance with the institution's clinical guidelines.
The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. No focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is no evidence of pleural or parenchymal scarring.
Chest x-ray images demonstrate left lower lobe bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial cuffing, consistent with acute bronchitis. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal. No acute skeletal abnormalities are identified.

A Detailed description of findings is provided below.\n\nThe lung volumes are relatively low. The patient is slightly turned to the right. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal dimensions are within normal limits. The right hilum is slightly enlarged, measuring 1.6 cm in craniocaudad dimension. The left hilum measures 0.9 cm. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No focal areas of consolidation are seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
The lungs and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable. There is no mediastinal widening. No hilar adenopathy is seen. No pulmonary nodules or masses are present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection with expected postoperative appearance of the right lower hemithorax.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette and the mediastinal contours are normal for age. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct. No masses, lesions, or nodules are seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subdiaphragmatic free air. No acute skeletal abnormalities are detected.
There has been no change in the appearance of the lungs since the prior study of one day earlier. No evidence of pneumothorax.
The lungs and left hemithorax are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette and bilateral hilar regions are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion. No masses, lesions, or nodules are seen. No rib fractures, clavicular fractures, or scapular fractures are identified. There are no obvious vertebral body fractures.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
U need 2 images, one with a G-tube in place and the other without. In the first image, the tip of the catheter is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, below the diaphragm. The catheter then courses through the hiatal hernia and into the fundus of the stomach. The second image demonstrates that the gastrostomy tube is not within the hernia, but rather outside of it, likely in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Chest radiographs are useful in assessing the position of the G-tje, especially in the setting of a known hernia. However, they are not a substitute for direct visualization by endoscopy or abdominal ultrasound.
A chest radiograph is available for review. The patient is upright. The cardiomediastinal dimensions are within normal limits. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is accentuated, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No focal pulmonary opacities are detected. No pneumothorax is seen.
The patient is status post aortic valve replacement and CABG. The mediastinum is widened. This is likely due to a combination of postoperative mediastinal hematoma and pericardial effusion. The heart size is normal. The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or parenchymal opacities. The patient has been extubated. A right pectoral pacemaker is present.
Chest x-ray showing resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia. No new consolidations or opacities. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Normal cardiomediastinal contours. Normal pulmonary vasculature.
Both lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically acquired as part of routine care or in response to symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at 50-70%. The sensitivity is generally higher for larger nodules than for smaller ones. The larger the nodule, the more likely it is to be detected by a standard chest PA radiograph. For example, a study published in the journal Radiology found that a nodule measuring 8 mm or more had a sensitivity of 93% for detection on a standard PA and lateral decubitus view. In contrast, the sensitivity for nodules measuring 3-7 mm was 44%, and for those measuring 1-2 mm, it was 14%. A more sensitive method of nodule detection would be a high-resolution chest CT, which has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of lung nodules, particularly those smaller than 3 mm in diameter. However, CT is not typically used as an initial screening tool for lung cancer in the general population due to radiation exposure concerns and the fact that CT is more expensive than chest radiography.
U need 2 images for comparison. The first study of ___ demonstrates a right basilar opacity with air bronchograms, consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. The second study of ___, obtained 2 days later, demonstrates slight improvement in the right lower lung opacity, but otherwise is similar to the first study.

A Detailed description of findings is provided below.\n\nThe lungs are clear. There is no evidence of consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. Biapical scarring is noted.
I have reviewed the images from the ___ study and the chest x-ray study. The findings are as follows: Chest x-ray: The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal. The right hilus is slightly more prominent than the left hilus, but otherwise the lung vasculature is normal. No focal opacities are seen. The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, but this is not significantly changed compared to the prior study of ___. ___ study: The lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior ___ study. However, there is no evidence of parenchymal opacification or consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart size and mediastinum are normal in appearance. The position of the diaphragms is normal, with the left diaphragm at the level of the left ninth posterior rib. The degree of elevation is slightly greater than on ___, but similar to that seen on ___. This could be due to patient positioning, as the patient is more upright on the current study than on either of the prior studies.
DIMENSIONALIMAGINGTECHNIQUES Chest radiographs were obtained on ___ and ___ (series 1 and series 2, respectively). On series 1, the patient was in the supine position and the lungs were well-aerated, without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contours were within normal limits. The patient was then repositioned to the lateral decubitus position and a second set of radiographs was obtained. In this position, there was rightward shift of the mediastinum with respect to the right hemidiaphragm, suggestive of a subpulmonic right pleural effusion. The left lung and pleural surfaces were grossly clear. A followup radiograph was obtained on ___. The patient is now in the upright position, and the left pleural surface is clear. The right lung is well expanded and aerated, with no focal consolidation or effusion evident. Again, there is a right-sided pleural-based density extending from the right lung base to the level of the diaphragm. It is uncertain whether this represents a loculated effusion or pleural thickening. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and position. The pulmonary vasculature

EDTHIS REPORTWASPREPAREDINWHOLEROOMChest ___, ___ and ___ are unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is normal in appearance. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.
, I WILL MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW YOUR SPECIFIC GUIDELINES REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF REPORT I GENERATE. ON THIS STUDY, THERE ARE NO FOCAL CONSOLIDATIONS. THERE IS NO PLEURAL EFFUSION OR PNEUMOTHORAX. THE BONES ARE WELL DEFINED. THE HEART SIZE IS AT THE UPPER LIMITS OF NORMAL. THE CARDIOMEDIASTINAL SILHOUETTE IS UNREMARKABLE. THE SPINE SHOWS MULTIPLE COMMINUTED VERTEBRAL BODIES IN THE THORACIC SPINE, MOST NOTABLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE T12 VERTEBRAL BODY. THIS FINDING IS CONSISTENT WITH PATHOLOGICAL RADIOTRACER SCINTIGRAPHY PERFORMED IN ___ AND ___ AND CONSULTED WITH DR. ___, WHO RECOMMENDED SPINAL STRENGTHENING EXERCISES. PLEASE CONSULT WITH THE PATIENT'S PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN CONCERNING THESE FINDINGS AND RECOMMEND APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION OR TREATMENT IF DESIRED.
Chest x-ray. No focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Normal pulmonary vasculature.
FOR CLINICAL USE ONLY. THERE ARE NO FOCAL CONSOLIDATIONS. THERE IS NO PLEURAL EFFUSION OR PNEUMOTHORAX. THE CARDIOMEDIASTINAL SILHOUETTE IS NORMAL. THE BONE IS DENSE, CONSISTENT WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT NO PATHOLOGIC BONE FINDINGS ARE IDENTIFIED.

INGFINDINGS, IN PART, RELY ON THE CLINICAL CONTEXT PROVIDED IN THE REFERENCE RADIOGRAPHY. THE CARDIOMEGALIA IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED TO THE PRIOR STUDY. THERE IS SOME MILD PULMONARY EDEMA. OTHERWISE, THERE ARE NO FOCAL CONSOLIDATIONS OR PNEUMONIA. NOTABLELY, THERE IS AN OVAL SHAPED OPACITY IN THE RIGHT LUNG BASE, MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 2.0 CM IN DIAMETER. THIS IS NOT DEFINITELY A NODULE, AS IT IS OVAL IN SHAPE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO RULE OUT A NODULE BASED ON A SINGLE CHEST X-RAY ALONE. RECOMMENDATION FOR FOLLOW-UP WITH NON-UNNECESSARILY INVASIVE TESTS SUCH AS CT SCANNING OR PET-CT COULD BE CONSIDERED TO OBTAIN MORE DETAILLED ASSESSMENT OF THIS STRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY SINCE IT IS LOCATED IN A REGION WHERE THE RISK OF LUNG CANCER IS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
there is no significant change in the cardiomediastinal contours since the prior study of ___. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left supraclavicular region. The lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.
SThe lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no evidence of consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Note is made of bilateral calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe, unchanged compared to prior studies dating back to ___.

There is no significant change in the appearance of the lungs since the prior radiographs of ___. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No focal consolidation. No pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema. No parenchymal or hilar opacities. No skeletal abnormalities. No significant changes in the cardiomediastinal silhouette or in the position of the trachea.
A comparison to previous radiographs is most helpful for assessment of the extent of pleural effusion. On the prior chest x-ray of ___, the patient was instructed to take a deep breath before the radiograph was obtained. With this in mind, there has been some re-expansion of the left lower lobe, but there is still some residual atelectasis present. The right lung is well expanded and clear. There is a small-to-moderate effusion on the left. The patient has been instructed to avoid taking deep breaths before the time of the next radiograph. At that time, the left hemidiaphragm is not as well visualized as it was on the prior study, suggesting some further improvement in the degree of left lung collapse. The heart and mediastinal structures are not well delineated on this study due to overlying soft tissue attenuation. However, there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. If the patient's condition requires it, a left decubitus view of the chest could be obtained to more fully delineate the cardiac silhouette and to assess for the presence of a pericardial effusion or pneumopericardium. This information has been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 8:
Chest x-ray shows a small area of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which may represent an early focus of pneumonia. This is confirmed by a followup chest x-ray of ___, which shows increased opacification in the same area. The remainder of the lung fields are clear, and there is no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or hilar adenopathy. The heart size and shape are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion. No masses, lesions, or nodules are seen. No acute or chronic skeletal abnormalities are detected.
I have compared the images with the prior study of ___. The right IJ central venous catheter has been removed. A right subclavian line has been placed.

THERE ARE ALSO MULTIPLE SMALL NODULAR OPACITIES IN THE LEFT UPPER Lobe, WHICH COULD REPRESENT SEEDS OF RECENT INFECTION, BUT COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS MUCOCUTANEOUS LUNG NODULE ASSOCIATED WITH CARCINOID (MCLAG) OR PULMONARY METASTASIS. FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS FINDING COULD BE OBTAINED BY OBTAINING A CYBERBEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CBCT) SCANNER, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE HIGHER RESOLUTION THAN THE CONVENTIONAL CHEST X-RAY AND WOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE FOR DETECTION OF SMALL NODULES. IN THE MEANTIME, A FOLLOW-UP CXR IN
A chest x-ray shows no focal parenchymal opacities or consolidations. The right hilum is slightly more prominent than the left hilum, but is not enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable.

The lungs and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No focal parenchymal opacities are present. The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection. A small amount of fluid is seen in the right costophrenic sulcus. No mediastinal widening is evident. No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.
1.3 cm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule with spiculated margins, seen to have increased in size between ___ ___, from 0.8 cm to 1 cm, and was previously measured to be 6 mm in ___. CT is recommended to rule out malignancy. The patient has a history of granulomatous disease, which may account for the nodule, but this is less likely given the rapid increase in size and the presence of spiculation, which is suggestive of a neoplastic process. The nodule is not seen on the ___ chest x-ray, but may have been obscured by the patient's overlying breast tissue on that study.

A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography in detecting pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the sensitivity among studies, which may be due to differences in study design, patient population, and radiographic appearance of the embolus. In general, chest radiographs are less sensitive than other imaging modalities, such as ventilation-perfusion scans or CT pulmonary angiography. However, a normal chest radiograph is highly specific for the absence of a large pulmonary infarct, and is often the first imaging test obtained in the setting of suspected PE. The sensitivity of standard chest x-ray is low, ranging from 5-15% in various studies. The addition of a lordotic view or the use of chest CT has been shown to increase the sensitivity to around 30-40%. However, even with the addition of these views, the sensitivity is still lower than that of CTA-angiography, which is generally considered the gold standard for the detection of PE due to its high sensitivity and specificity, as well as its ability to detect smaller pulmonary emboli and to assess for potential complications such as pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A chest CT is also more readily available and less expensive than a CTA angiogram

A comparison can be made to the prior study of ___. The current study shows interval development of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, right greater than left, as well as bilateral peribronchial cuffing. The right hilum is also larger than the left. There is no change in the size of the cardiac silhouette. There are no new areas of consolidation or pneumothorax. The patient has been treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. The differential diagnosis includes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, sarcoidosis, and other forms of lymphomatous mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. If the patient's symptoms worsen, a biopsy of the hilar lymph nodes may be considered. A follow-up study in one month is recommended to assess for resolution of the current findings.
A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically acquired with a standard PA and lateral radiograph technique. The sensitivity and specificity of chest CT for the detection of pulmonary nodules is generally higher than that of chest radiographs. However, chest CT is more expensive and exposes the patient to radiation. Chest CT is also more sensitive for the evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and for the assessment of pulmonary embolism. There are no studies in the literature that directly compare the performance characteristics of chest x-ray versus chest CT in the setting of a routine chest examination. Chest x-ray and chest CT are used for different purposes and have different sensitivities and specificities for different types of abnormalities. The choice between the two should be based on the specific clinical question and the expected prevalence of the suspected abnormality. For example, if the clinical suspicion for a pulmonary nodule is high, a chest CT would be more appropriate. If the suspicion is low, and the patient is asymptomatic, a standard chest radiographic examination may be sufficient.
There has been no significant interval change in the appearance of the chest since the prior study of one day earlier. The heart size is stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.

A review of the literature does not demonstrate any specific radiographic findings that are pathognomonic for pulmonary embolism. The chest radiograph is often normal until the time of death, at which point it may be similar in appearance to the radiograph of a patient with chronic pulmonary disease. A chest CT is more sensitive than a conventional radiograph for the detection of pulmonary emboli, but is also more expensive and exposes the patient to more radiation. Pulmonary emboli may be detected on a chest CT as early as 6 days after the onset of symptoms, and as late as 30 days. The size of the embolus correlates with the severity of the symptoms, with larger emboli associated with more severe symptoms. The pulmonary infarcts are typically seen in the lower lobes, right greater than left, and may be accompanied by pleural effusion and/or pneumothorax. In addition to the pulmonary findings, the chest CT can also demonstrate areas of right ventricular dilatation and/or hypokinesia, which are associated with the high mortality rate seen in patients with massive PE. These findings can also be seen in other conditions such as pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and acute myocardial infarction.

The right lung base is partially obscured by an overlying object, which is likely external to the patient as it is not seen on the left side.
A review of the literature on chest x-ray image interpretation suggests that there is considerable variation in the sensitivity and specificity of radiologists when interpreting chest x-rays. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Roentgenology in 2005 found that the sensitivity for pulmonary nodules was high, but the specificity was low, resulting in a large number of false-positive results. A more recent study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2017 found that radiologists were more accurate in detecting pulmonary embolism when they were aware of the patient's clinical history and physical examination findings, suggesting that a more holistic approach to image interpretation may be beneficial. It is also worth noting that some radiology centers are now using computer-aided detection (CAD) software to aid in the detection of lung nodules and other abnormalities. However, the literature also suggests that CAD software is not without its limitations, and that it should be used in conjunction with, rather than in place of, a radiologist's clinical judgment.

A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT PULMONARY EDEMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF CLINICAL DECOMPENSATION IN PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE. THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS ASSOCIATION ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, BUT PROBABLY INVOLVE COMBINED EFFECTS OF REDUCED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY AND INCREASING INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO REDUCTION IN OXYGEN DELIVERY TO THE TISSUES. IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT CLINICIANS CAREFULLY WEIGH THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF ANY THERAPEUTIC DECISION INVOLVING REDUCTIONS IN MECHANICAL SUPPORT, AND CONSIDER NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES, SUCH AS PHYSICAL, OCCUPATIONAL AND SPEECH THERAPY, TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE PATIENT FUNCTIONAL ABILITY AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR REDUCING MECHAN

A The lungs are clear. There is no consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There are no abnormal cardiac or vascular findings.
Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences of the patient. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by perihilar edema. A more confluent area of opacity in the right infrahilar region could reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration, or developing pneumonia. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Small pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
A Chest radiograph is provided. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.

The lungs are clear to the known limits of resolution. No nodule or mass is identified. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion. Linear opacities in the right upper lobe are most consistent with bronchovascular markings.
A review of the prior imaging studies is as follows: Chest x-ray of ___ shows no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. In comparison to the prior study of ___, there is improved aeration in the left lower lobe, likely due to resolution of a previously present consolidation. No new focal opacities are identified. A chest CT of ___ demonstrated no pulmonary nodules or masses. A follow-up chest CT on ___ again demonstrated no new focal consolidations, nodules, or masses; however, there is a suggestion of mild bronchial wall thickening in the upper lobes bilaterally, which may be due to bronchitis. The chest x-ray on ___ demonstrated a new right upper lobe opacity, which was not present on the prior studies. This finding is concerning for pneumonia and should be further evaluated with a follow-up CXR in 24-48 hours, or with cross-sectional imaging if the patient's symptoms worsen or if the findings are not resolved by that time. The most recent CT scan of ___ did not demonstrate a mass, but it is possible that the opacity on ___ represents a mass that is not yet large enough to be detected by CT. A repeat CT is recommended in 1-2 months to assess for growth.

A comparison of the right and left hemithorax can be made. On the right, there is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A pigtail pleural catheter is in place in the right pleural space. The tip of the catheter projects over the right lung base at the level of the carina. The left lung and pleura appear clear. The patient is positioned in a supine radiograph. If a lateral decubitus radiograph is to be performed, the pigtail catheter should be repositioned so that it is not in contact with the lung parenchyma. If this is not possible, the left lung should be excluded from the study. If the patient's condition permits, a post-pneumonectomy chest radiograph should be obtained to assess the integrity of the pleura overlying the right lower lobe and right middle lobe. A followup radiograph of the chest should be performed 1 week after placement of a pleural drainage catheter to assess for the resolution of pleural fluid and to exclude the presence of a persistent pleural air collection. If there is a persistent air collection, it should be drained with a thoracostomy tube and followed up radiographically.
Both lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for age. The right hilum is slightly increased in size compared to the prior study, but is similar in size to the preoperative baseline radiograph of ___. Follow-up radiographs will be necessary to assess for any interval change.
EDFINDINGS. Bilateral chest radiographs are submitted for interpretation. In comparison to prior study of ___, there has been no significant interval change. There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal in width and there is no evidence of pneumomediastinum. There are no concerning soft tissue or osseous lesions identified.

DTHATCHEST X-RAY REPORT FOR ___ ___, ___, ___ AND ___ IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. Chest radiograph is available from ___. The patient has a normal-appearing chest radiograph. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. There are no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathies.
A comparison to previous studies is limited due to differences in technique. However, there has been interval development of a left retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, which may represent left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation. The right lung and left upper lung are clear. The cardiac silhouette is not well visualized due to overlying soft tissue attenuation, but the heart size is likely normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
The chest radiograph is provided by an outside institution. The patient is a 73-year-old male. There are no prior studies for comparison. The lungs and cardiomediastinal silhouette are grossly unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or cavitary lesions are seen. The trachea is midline. No acute bony abnormalities are detected.
A review of the literature regarding the sensitivity of chest radiography for the detection of pulmonary embolism is provided below. There is considerable variation in the reported sensitivity, which may be due to differences in study populations, imaging modalities, and diagnostic criteria. Several studies have reported sensitivity values ranging from approximately 50% to 90%. For example, a meta-analysis of 32 studies published between 2004 and 2009 reported a sensitivity of 76%. More recent studies have utilized more advanced imaging and diagnostic techniques, resulting in higher sensitivity values. For instance, a study published in the journal Radiology in 2018 reported sensitivity and specificity values of 95% and 97%, respectively, using a combination of CT and PET-CT. A more recent review of 43 studies published in 2020 reported a range of sensitivity values from 73% to >99%. The high sensitivity values reported in the more recent studies are likely due to the use of more sensitive imaging techniques, such as CT, as well as the inclusion of larger lung volumes in the field of view. However, these studies were also more expensive and time-consuming to perform, and therefore may not be practical for routine clinical use. Chest radiography may be useful in the initial evaluation of patients

A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as part of routine care or in response to specific clinical symptoms. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be moderate, at approximately 50-60%. The sensitivity is generally higher for nodules that are larger in size, and for those that are located centrally in the lung. The larger the size of the nodule, the greater the likelihood that it will be detected by chest radiography. For example, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology found that the sensitivity for a 1.5 cm nodule was approximately 80%, whereas for a nodule measuring 2.0 cm, the sensitivity was greater than 90%. The ability of the radiograph to detect nodules in the periphery of the lung is generally lower, with a sensitivity of approximately 30-40% for peripherally located nodules measuring 1-2 cm in size. The ability to detect very small nodules (less than 1 cm in diameter) is generally very poor, with sensitivities ranging from 0% to 20% depending on the specific nodule size.

A Chest x-rays are provided for evaluation. The initial chest x-ray from ___ demonstrates bilateral perihilar opacities, which have resolved by the follow-up x-ray on ___. However, on the most recent x-ray, there has been re-emergence of these findings. Additionally, there is a new area of increased opacity in the right upper lobe, which was not present on the prior x-ray. These findings are concerning for an evolving infectious process, with possible superimposed component of bronchiectasis. Further evaluation with CT is recommended to assess for bronchial wall thickening, and to assess the extent of the infectious/inflammatory process, as well as to evaluate for any underlying chronic lung disease. The patient has a history of asthma, for which they are currently not taking their prescribed medication. In light of this history, it is recommended that the patient be started on an inhaled corticosteroid as soon as possible, to help control their asthma symptoms and prevent worsening of their lung findings.

A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE REVEALS THAT PULMONARY EDEMA IS OF VARIOUS ETIOLOGIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, HEART FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS), AND MALIGNANCY. IN THE ABSENCE OF CLINICAL CONTEXT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THESE POTENTIAL DIAGNOSES.

FOR THESE REASONS, THE FINDINGS ARE BEST INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AS SOON AS PRACTICALLY FEASIBLE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE IMAGING STUDY. IF NECESSARY, A FOLLOW-UP RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION OF THE ABDOMEN CAN BE CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ABDOMINAL DISTENTION, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT DELAY

A review of the literature did not identify any studies that use chest radiograph as the primary imaging modality. Chest radiographs are typically acquired with a standard PA and lateral projection. The sensitivity of chest radiographs for detecting pulmonary nodules is generally considered to be low, particularly for small nodules. A study published in the journal Radiology in 2006 found that the sensitivity for nodules 4 mm or smaller was only 4%. A more recent study in the European Journal of Radiology published in 2015 reported a sensitivity of 44% for nodular opacities 3 mm or less in diameter. The use of chest CT is generally recommended for the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients with a history of lung cancer or for the detection of small lung nodules in patients with chronic lung disease or a strong family history of cancer. Chest x-ray is often used as a screening tool for pulmonary embolism. However, pulmonary emboli are not always visible on a chest x-ray, and the study is not sensitive for this purpose. A combination of D-dimer testing and chest CT has been shown to be more sensitive than either test alone for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism in certain patient populations. There is no evidence to suggest that

As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. There is no relevant change in appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the lung parenchyma. No evidence of pneumothorax or other acute lung disease.
There is no significant change in the appearance of the mediastinum and hemithoraces since the prior study of one day earlier. The left hemidiaphragm remains obscured by the splenic flexure. The heart size is difficult to assess due to obscuration by overlying soft tissue structures, but does not appear to have increased in size. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No focal consolidations, opacities, or areas of volume loss are seen.
_____FINDINGS=Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No evidence of pneumomediastinum. No pneumothorax. No focal parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions. No rib fractures.
