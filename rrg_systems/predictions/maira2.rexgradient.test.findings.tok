However, a more diffuse bilateral lung abnormality is also present, and could reflect some component of bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes. However, the possibility of a component of edema or pneumonitis is difficult to exclude. With this in mind, PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful when the patient's condition permits.
