PA and lateral views of the chest. No prior. The lungs are clear. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
The lungs are clear. The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Aorta is tortuous and calcified. Lungs are clear except for minimal linear scar or atelectasis at the left base. There are no pleural effusions. Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of a compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age.
Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina, left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube coils within the fundus of the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Lungs are hyperexpanded, and note is made of bilateral upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema. No focal areas of consolidation are evident within the lungs to suggest the presence of pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lung parenchyma when the patient's condition permits.
Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are present. No focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no pleural effusions. Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of mild compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age. Surgical clips are present in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size for technique. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are clear except for minimal linear atelectasis or scarring at the left base. There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
The patient is status post right upper lobe resection with expected volume loss in the right hemithorax and rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Post-operative changes are present within the right juxtahilar region, and note is made of a right apical hydropneumothorax. Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.
PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with expected postoperative changes in the right hemithorax including volume loss and pleural thickening. The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. Cervical spinal hardware is partially imaged.
Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the right chest wall. Worsening right upper lobe opacification is likely due to a combination of post-operative atelectasis and contusion in the setting of recent wedge resection procedure. Adjacent small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated. Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax with visceral apical pleural line at the level of the third posterior right rib. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the right chest wall extending into the right supraclavicular and cervical regions. Worsening opacification of the right upper lobe is likely due to worsening atelectasis and/or consolidation in this region, and note is also made of a slight increase in rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Within the left lung, there is a new poorly defined opacity in the left perihilar region, which could reflect an area of aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with COPD. There are no focal areas of consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Post-surgical changes are noted in the right hemithorax with evidence of prior right upper lobe wedge resection. Cervical spine fusion hardware is incompletely evaluated on this study.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change. Lungs are hyperexpanded but grossly clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring appear similar to the prior study, and note is made of previous cervical spine surgery.
Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the right chest wall. Worsening heterogeneous opacities are present within the right upper lobe and to a lesser extent the right lower lobe, and could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Left lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax.

The patient is status post esophagectomy and pull-up procedure. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Worsening airspace opacities are present at both lung bases, and could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Subcutaneous emphysema in right chest wall has slightly decreased in extent. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Left lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear.
