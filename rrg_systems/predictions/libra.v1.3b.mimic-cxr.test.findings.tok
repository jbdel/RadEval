Dr. ___ was successfully paged at the time of this dictation on ___. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 8:30 a.m. on ___ at time of discovery. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, right greater than left. Diffuse interstitial opacities are present, and may be due to chronic interstitial lung disease, but acute interstitial edema should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the aortic arch. A dialysis catheter is in place, with tip terminating in the right atrium. Surgical clips are noted in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions of the abdomen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Bones are diffusely demineralized, and degenerative changes are present at the right acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints, as well as within the thoracic spine.
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right IJ dialysis catheter that terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities are again seen, consistent with pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of severe cardiomegaly. The possibility of supervening aspiration or pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, more prominent on the right than on the left.
Dr. ___ was notified by telephone on ___ at 8:30 a.m. at the time of dictation of this report. Moderate cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. More confluent opacities in the right infrahilar region and left retrocardiac region may reflect dependent edema and atelectasis, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted. Central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Bones are diffusely demineralized, and compression deformities are present in the mid thoracic spine as well as a lower thoracic vertebral body, of indeterminate age.
Dr. ___ was notified by telephone at 8:30 a.m. on ___ at the time of dictation of this report. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and result in crowding of bronchovascular structures. Allowing for this factor, heart is upper limits of normal in size. Lungs are clear except for a calcified granuloma in the right mid lung region. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Dialysis catheter is in place, with tip terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction.

Hemodialysis catheter tip again extends to the lower portion of the right atrium.
Left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the right atrium. Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema.

Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have worsened in the interval, particularly in the left perihilar and right basilar regions. Observed findings may reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but coexisting aspiration or infection are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. Small right pleural effusion is present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
