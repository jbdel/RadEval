The lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiac size is normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal in caliber. The bony thorax is grossly intact. The trachea is midline. The visualized portions of both carotid arteries demonstrate no significant atherosclerotic calcifications. There is no evidence of acute fracture within the limits of a conventional chest radiograph. However, if there is clinical suspicion for rib fractures, then dedicated rib radiographs are recommended. If there is high clinical concern for spine injury, then a dedicated spine radiograph is recommended.
The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for age. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal silhouettes are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are no focal consolidations, masses, lesions, or opacities. Compared with prior radiograph from ___, there is no significant change.
The lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size is normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The bony thorax is intact.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size with only a small residual effusion remaining on the right and no visible effusion on the left. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities are present, most pronounced in the left lower lobe, but also seen to a lesser degree in the right middle lobe and both upper lobes. These findings are most likely due to edema and alveolar hemorrhage in the setting of massive hemoptysis. However, superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically. Dr. ___ would like to speak with the patient's pulmonologist regarding the possibility of bronchial artery embolization.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared to the prior study. Multifocal areas of consolidation are present in both lower lobes, and could represent multifocal pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Atelectasis is present in the right middle lobe. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
The lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged. Compared to the prior radiograph from ___, there has been resolution of the pulmonary edema.
The lungs are clear. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vascular markings are normal. There are no areas of parenchymal opacities concerning for pneumonia. There is no free air in the upper abdomen. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
The lungs are clear without infiltrate or consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal. Mediastinal structures are normal. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lungs are clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bones are grossly unremarkable.
The lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and bony structures are normal.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
The patient is markedly rotated to the left. Allowing for this factor, cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for rotation. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bones are grossly unremarkable to mildly demineralized for age.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Both lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Compared with ___ at 10:30 a.m. there is no relevant change.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. There are no focal consolidations or pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Bony thorax is grossly intact.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bony thorax is grossly intact.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities have slightly improved, particularly in the left upper lobe. No new or worsening areas of consolidation are identified, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude on the basis of this single portable chest radiograph.
